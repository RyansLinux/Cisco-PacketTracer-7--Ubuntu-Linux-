Start-
Open terminal (ctrl+ Alt + t) , Then use the following commands :
➢ ls Downloads
( you will see the files listed which are in the folder,
.... Downloads / PacketTracer7.tar.gz)


-Then: ➢ chmod +x Downloads/PacketTracer7.tar.gz

..... an output will appear, 


-Now change file directory (cd) as follows:

-Another prompt again:

-Again another prompt will appear:
-should we create a symbolic link "packettracer" in /usr/local/bin for easy Cisco Packet Tracer startup? [Y or n]
-just press
➢ y
-Then
➢ Enter
-Now use the list directory command again:

.......The output should look like:

-The needed file is: set_ptenv.sh
....So the following command should be used now:

-Now to execute the program command:
➢ packettracer
-Cisco Packet Tracer will open and Cisco username and password
will be requested to log into your Netacad acct.
